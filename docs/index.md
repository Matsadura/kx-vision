# KX-Vision Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the KX-Vision project.

This repository serves as a knowledge base detailing the reverse-engineered architecture of Guild Wars 2 and the methodologies used to build this tool. Our goal is to provide clear, maintainable, and well-documented code for the open-source community.

### Key Sections

- **[Concepts](./concepts/multithreading-model.md):**
  High-level explanations of core game engine concepts that are fundamental to how this tool operates, such as the game's multi-threaded architecture.

- **[Engine Internals](./engine_internals/index.md):**
  Detailed analysis of the specific game functions and data access strategies we use. This section is crucial for understanding how we find and interact with game data in a stable and reliable way.
